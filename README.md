# PatientQueue---CS106
This program focuses on implementing an abstract data type using an array as the internal data structure.
It manages a waiting line of patients to be processed at a hospital. Patients should be seen in an order related to their urgency.In our simulation, the hospital can choose to manage their queue in one of two ways:
min: First help the patient with the minimum integer priority value(most urgent) since their life may depend on it; Or
max: First help the patient with maximum integer priority value(least urgent) since they will not take as much time to process and can be served quickly
